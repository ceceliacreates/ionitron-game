# Ionitron: The Game

### Gameplay
In this game, you are Ionitron, a hard-working cross-platform developer! You use your web skills to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using Ionic and Capacitor.

The success of your apps depend on creating a great user experience. Your score increases when your users are happy, but unhappy users can tank your rating. Whatever you do, avoid the bugs!

New test devices and a hot pot of coffee will prevent bugs and bad reviews, but they don't last forever.

Good luck!
